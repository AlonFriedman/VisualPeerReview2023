# VisualPeerReview2023
This study analyzes peer review data collected in an undergraduate visual literacy course for the last five years using Naïve Bayes modeling. 
We expand on the research of Friedman & Rosen (2017) and Beasley et al. (2021 and 2022) by focusing on the Naïve Bayes model classifier students' remarks.
